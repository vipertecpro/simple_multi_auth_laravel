## About Laravel Multi Auth

In generally every project have two main ends back-end and front-end, so i group each individually in route so that we can have separate flow of information. 
 Let's clear up basics first :

- Install laravel with composer : composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel your_project_name.
- Make Auth using command : php artisan make:auth.

Now let's create two seperate sets in each of the followings :-

**In "app/Http/Controllers"**

- Create two directories : "Admin" and "Front"
- Copy and Paste Auth folder in both of the above created folder.
- 

**In "routes/web.php"**

-
**In "resources/views"**
